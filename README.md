  # NoSQL Fitness Tracker

  
  # Description
  The Fitness Tracker app allows users to create and track workouts.

   Users are able to:
    
    * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

    * Add new exercises to a new workout plan on a given day.

    * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

    * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page. The app also tracks cardio exercises and can record distance traveled.

    * View live graphs or your progress in the dashboard of the app!

  The app is deployed on Heroku and can be found here [https://anderson-fitness-tracker.herokuapp.com/?id=614d3e47f188341d22386484] and uses MongoDB Cloud Atlas to store the data on the backend.
